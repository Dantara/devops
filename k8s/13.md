# Helm StatefulSet

## Proceeded steps

1. `kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc` output:
``` 
>>> kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc

2. Access our service several times from different environmets;

3. Obtain visits logs from each pod;
```
>>> kubectl exec pod/devops-python-app-0 -- tail -n 5 /app/logs/visits.log
23:29:34
23:29:44
23:29:44
23:29:54
23:29:54

>>> kubectl exec pod/devops-python-app-1 -- tail -n 5 /app/logs/visits.log
23:29:44
23:29:54
23:29:54
23:30:04
23:30:04

>>> kubectl exec pod/devops-python-app-2 -- tail -n 5 /app/logs/visits.log
23:29:44
23:29:54
23:29:54
23:30:04

```

4. Explaination of differences between the output of the command for replicas:

    All pods are tring to read from a singular. It has no locks which leads to inconsistancy due to race conditions and performance degradation. To prevent it, the Stateful state utilizes `volumeClaimTemplates` making all instances operating over different copies of a signle files. It leads to difference in results.
    
5. Why ordering guarantees are not necessary in our case:

    In some cases, we want to preserve ordering, for example when we need to start-up a master node first, then connect some workers to it. Our instances are independent of each other, therefore ordering is unnecessary.
    
6. Launching pods in parallel.

We need to update our `values.yaml` and add:
```
statefulSet:
  podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 256M
```
